HEADER & FOOTER OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
===================================

✅ COMPLETED OPTIMIZATION
Created a common header and footer component system using jQuery AJAX to dynamically load components across all pages.

📁 NEW FILES CREATED:
1. /includes/header.html - Common header component
2. /includes/footer.html - Common footer component

📝 MODIFIED FILES:
1. /js/script.js - Added loadHeader(), loadFooter(), and related functions
2. /index.html - Replaced hardcoded header with #header-container
3. /pages/news.html - Replaced hardcoded header with #header-container, footer with #footer-container
4. /pages/contact.html - Replaced hardcoded header with #header-container, footer with #footer-container
5. /pages/vilay.html - Replaced hardcoded header with #header-container, footer with #footer-container
6. /pages/opinion.html - Replaced hardcoded header with #header-container, footer with #footer-container

🎯 KEY BENEFITS:
✓ Single source of truth for header and footer
✓ Automatic navigation link management via data-page attributes
✓ Path-aware link generation (handles root and nested pages)
✓ Reduced code duplication across all pages
✓ Easier maintenance - update header/footer once, affects all pages
✓ Cleaner HTML files

⚙️ HOW IT WORKS:

1. HEADER LOADING:
   - jQuery loads /includes/header.html
   - Inserts into #header-container div
   - Detects current page and sets active nav link
   - Updates nav links with correct paths based on current location

2. FOOTER LOADING:
   - jQuery loads /includes/footer.html
   - Inserts into #footer-container div
   - Updates footer links with correct paths based on current location

3. SMART PATH HANDLING:
   - Detects if page is in root (/) or pages directory (/pages/)
   - Automatically adjusts relative paths:
     * From root: 'pages/vilay.html'
     * From /pages/: 'vilay.html'
     * Home link: '../index.html' from /pages/, 'index.html' from root

4. AUTOMATIC ACTIVE STATE:
   - Reads current page from URL pathname
   - Maps filename to page identifier
   - Applies 'active' class to matching nav link

📊 STRUCTURE:

Before (Code Duplication):
index.html (with header) -----
pages/news.html (with header) |--- 5 copies of same header
pages/contact.html (with header) |
pages/vilay.html (with header) |
pages/opinion.html (with header) -----

After (DRY Principle):
includes/header.html (1 copy) <--- All pages reference this

⚡ FUTURE UPDATES:
To modify header or footer globally:
1. Edit /includes/header.html or /includes/footer.html
2. Changes automatically reflect on all pages (no page reload needed on server)

🔄 JQUERY DEPENDENCIES:
- jQuery 3.6.0 (already included in all pages)
- Uses $.ajax() for loading HTML
- Uses $.when() for parallel loading
- DOM manipulation with $() selectors

✅ VERIFICATION:
All HTML files have been validated:
- Header containers created and properly placed
- Footer containers created and properly placed
- Script loading order maintained (jQuery before Bootstrap before custom script)
- Data attributes configured for automatic navigation
